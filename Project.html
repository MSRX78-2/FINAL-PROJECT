        <h3>Project Description: </h3>
        <p>
            The hardware of this program is my own original design, and the software is my original programming using max MSP. Since I was a child, I liked and practiced classical opera, so from my daily practice, I wanted to make a small tool, even if I was connected in a small space, I could still feel the effect of theater and even records, and there was also physical cooling, because singing requires the help of the body's core, which will make the body produce heat.
	The software includes sustain, reverseFX, delay, vinyl, and MAX's native AUMatrixReverb effects, as well as Arduino programs that interact with hardware. The hardware uses the single-chip microcomputer of the Arduino hardware that comes with the previous robot examination,Breadboard,Wire,Fan and tricolor lights,Through the loudness of my singing, let the program that interacts with the hardware control fan,The louder the speed,The smaller the loudness, the slower the speed,No loudness does not work,To achieve the purpose of environmental protection,The lamp detects the specific vibration frequency of the corresponding scale through the program,Display the real-time scale,Ensure the specification of my singing„ÄÇ
	This project is a dream I have always had since I was a child, and in this way, it explores more possible ways for the future of music technology.
